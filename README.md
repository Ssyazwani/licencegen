### Objective : 
Creating a licence generating system to make the license assignment a smoother process
licensearray.cpp : *To generate licence number the number must be in chronologically order for example "001M" - "999M" to be able to keep track of licensees*
randomlicence.cpp : *To generate licence number the number must be in a random order in the range of "001M" - "999M" to be able to keep track of licensees* - perhaps for car licence 

###  Current Issues: 
*Working on* A function to not allowing duplication of names unless the pervious license number is invalid, so license number has to be unique
Activities has more fields to considered, To make a view database functions
