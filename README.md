 *To generate licence number the number must be in chronologically order for example "001M" - "999M"*
 
### Things to note: 
if there are duplications ( multiple applications but using the same entity - follow the number that has already been assigned for the first application) to save data - function to update data and keep dat

###  Current Issues: 
Printing date again and again, Activities has more fields to considered - maybe change to just types, To make a view database functions

*Considering a work in progress project--> make java/railway website to input records and save data and show data*
